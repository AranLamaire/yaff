Yaff stands for "Yet another force field". It is a pythonic force-field code
used by Toon and Louis to test-drive their new models. The original motivation
to develop Yaff was to provide a good reference implementation of the force
fields developed at the Center for Molecular Modeling (CMM) at Ghent University.
In its current version, Yaff is general and flexible enough to handle a large
variety of force field models.
